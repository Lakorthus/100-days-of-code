# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sep 22, Thurday 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have joined the 100 days of code challenge and reviewed documentation about Git.

**Thoughts:** I was very confident using git and GitHub, but today explaining to someone I saw issues that we could not fix. After some research, I know where to look for the solution.

### Day 1: Sep 23, Friday 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have gone through many exercises on #codeWars to practice my javaScript. I also worked on my lightweight library "Caimito", like the exotic fruit from South America, created to make Sass easy, fun and customisable.

**Thoughts** I have recently started coding, and when I look back, it makes me proud of how much I have learned since April. I have much more to learn, but I also have to celebrate my accomplishments.

### Day 2: Sep 24, Saturday 2022

**Today's Progress**: A deeper understanding of the fundamentals of Web apps:
1. HTTP GET
2. Forms and HTTP POST
3. AJAX
4. Web Sequence Diagrams

**Thoughts**: I struggled with Web Sequence Diagrams and Forms and HTTP POST, but I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. This subject needs further studies to practice my understanding.

### Day 3: Sep 25, Sunday 2022

**Today's Progress**: Review fundamental core concepts of JavaScript:
1. Variables
2. Arrays
3. Objects
4. Functions
5. Object methods and "this".
6. Classes

Also, I have updated my IDE with VScode integrated with GitHub. Tomorrow I will be starting at the School of Code.

**Thoughts** Tomorrow I will be starting at the School of Code, I can wait to give all my best.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
