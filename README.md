# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sep 22, Thurday

**Today's Progress**: I have joined the 100 days of code challenge and reviewed documentation about Git.

**Thoughts:** I was very confident using git and GitHub, but today explaining to someone I saw issues that we could not fix. After some research, I know where to look for the solution.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
